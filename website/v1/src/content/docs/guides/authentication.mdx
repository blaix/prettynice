  In the meantime, you can get [HTTP Basic Auth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)
  set up by [generating a token](https://www.debugbear.com/basic-auth-header-generator) for a username/pass of your choice
  and passing it as an Authorization header with [Prettynice.Response.setHeader](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/1/module/Prettynice.Response#setHeader).
