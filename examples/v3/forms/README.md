# Form Example

Normal `<form>` elements with `action="post"` will have the data available at `request.formData`:

It is a `FormData` value which is a mapping of field names to arrays of values.

You can use `get` to get a `Maybe String` of the first value associated with a field name,
or `getAll` to get an `Array String` of all values associated with the field name.

See [`server/src/Main.gren`](server/src/Main.gren) for the full working example.

Run it from this directory with `npm install && npm run dev`
or from the root of this repo with `just example forms`.
