<Aside type="note">
  This page needs to be fleshed out.
  In the meantime, you can share code between `client/` and `server/` by putting the shared code in a third directory (e.g. `shared/`).
  Then listing that directory in the `source-directories` in both `client/gren.json` and `server/gren.json`.
