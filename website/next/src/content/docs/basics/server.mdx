import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Every request to your site begins in `server/src/Main.gren`.
If you generated your project with `prettynice init`, it will look something like this:

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Gen.Components.Counter
import Node exposing (Environment)
import Prettynice.SimpleRouter as Router
import Prettynice.Request exposing (Request)
import Prettynice.Response as Response exposing (Response)
import Transmutable.Html as H exposing (Html)
import Transmutable.Html.Attributes as A

main : Router.Program
main =
    Router.defineProgram
        { init = init
        , router = router
        }

init : Environment -> Router.Init
init env =
    Router.startProgram
        { host = "127.0.0.1"
        , port_ = 3000
        , env = env
        }

router : Request -> Response -> Cmd msg
router request response =
    case request.path of
        [] -> 
            response
                |> Response.sendHtml
                    { title = "My Website"
                    , head = [ linkStylesheet ]
                    , body = viewHomePage
                    }

        [ "hello", name ] ->
            response
                |> Response.sendText ("Hello, " ++ name)

        _ ->
            response
                |> Response.setStatus 404
                |> Response.sendText "Not found"

viewHomePage : Array (Html msg)
viewHomePage =
    [ H.h1 [] [ H.text "Welcome to my website!" ]
    , H.p [] [ H.text "I made this counter just for you." ]
    , Gen.Components.Counter.init { start = 0 }
    ]

linkStylesheet : Html msg
linkStylesheet =
    H.link [ A.rel "stylesheet", A.href "/styles.css" ]
```

If you aren't familiar with gren, it would be a good idea to read through [the book](https://gren-lang.org/book/) first.
The rest of this guide will assume basic familiarity with gren and focus on the parts specific to prettynice.

## Defining your Program

We start with a `main` function that defines a [`SimpleRouter`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter)
using [`defineProgram`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter#defineProgram):

```elm
main : Router.Program
main =
    Router.defineProgram
        { init = init
        , router = router
        }
```

It takes your `init` and `router` functions, which we will go over next.

<Aside>
    [`Prettynice.SimpleRouter`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter).
    is good enough for many things, even complicated client-side interactivity.
    But if you need more server-side control - to read or write files, talk to
    a database, use custom javascript, or do other things that can affect the
    state of the world outside of your HTTP response - you can [define a full program](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice#defineProgram)
    instead. If you want more information on full programs, you can jump ahead
    to [The Elm Architecture](/next/tea/).
</Aside>

## Starting your Program

Your `init` function should call [`startProgram`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.SimpleRouter#startProgram).
This is where you define the host and port the server will listen on:

```elm
init : Environment -> Router.Init
init env =
    Router.startProgram
        { host = "127.0.0.1"
        , port_ = 3000
        , env = env
        }
```

## Routing Requests

The heart of your server is the router function.
Every request to your site will call this function,
with a [request](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.Request#Request)
holding information about the request, and a
[response](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.Response)
that you can use to respond to the request:

```elm
router : Request -> Response -> Cmd msg
router request response =
    case request.path of
        [] -> 
            response
                |> Response.sendHtml
                    { title = "My Website"
                    , head = [ linkStylesheet ]
                    , body = viewHomePage
                    }

        [ "hello", name ] ->
            response
                |> Response.sendText ("Hello, " ++ name)

        _ ->
            response
                |> Response.setStatus 404
                |> Response.sendText "Not found"
```

`request.path` is an array of strings. It holds the path portion of the URL split on `/`.
For example, requesting `127.0.0.1:3000/bowties/are/cool` would have a `request.path` of `["bowties", "are", "cool"]`.
Requesting the root path would have an empty array (`[]`).

You can also match on other things, like the [HTTP method](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/4/module/HttpServer#Method):

```elm
    case request of
        { method = POST, path = "/login" } -> 
```

Take a look at the [Request](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.Request#Request)
record and see the pages on [pattern matching](https://gren-lang.org/book/syntax/pattern_matching/)
and [destructuring](https://gren-lang.org/book/syntax/destructuring/) in the gren book for help here.

## Send HTML

For the homepage, we're using [Response.sendHtml](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/blaix/prettynice/version/2/module/Prettynice.Response#sendHtml)
to render HTML:

```elm
router : Request -> Response -> Cmd msg
router request response =
    case request.path of
        [] -> 
            response
                |> Response.sendHtml
                    { title = "My Website"
                    , head = [ linkStylesheet ]
                    , body = viewHomePage
                    }

        ...
```

Because prettynice needs some control over the `<head>` and `<body>` tags, you have some fields to inject what you need into the page:

* `title`: Sets the `<title>` tag. Here we're rendering `<title>My Website</title>`
* `head`: An array of HTML that will be injected into the `<head>` tag. Here we're deferring to a `linkStylesheet` function to link to a stylesheet. That will be covered in the next section.
* `body`: An array of HTML to make up the `<body>` of your page. Here we're deferring to a `viewHomePage` function for this.

<Aside>
    Prettynice expects [Transmutable.Html](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/icidasset/html-gren/version/4/module/Transmutable.Html),
    which has the same API as the normal [Html from the browser package](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/version/4/module/Html),
    except that it can be rendered server-side.
</Aside>

<Aside>
    We're aliasing the `Html` module as `H` and the `Html.Attributes` module as `A` to save typing without exposing every function from those modules.
    The below docs will be using those aliases, but you can call them whatever you want in your own code, expose everything (`exposing (..)`),
    or use the fully qualified import without an alias.
</Aside>

## Assets and Styling

In the `linkStylesheet` function we're linking to `/styles.css`:

```elm
linkStylesheet : Html msg
linkStylesheet =
    H.link [ A.rel "stylesheet", A.href "/styles.css" ]
```

`styles.css` was created by `prettynice init` and placed in the `public/` directory.
Any files in `public/` will be accessible at the root url path.
So you can put other things there like images, fonts, etc. and reference them in your HTML anywhere you need them.

## Initialize Components

The `viewHomePage` function returns the HTML for our home page:

```elm
viewHomePage : Array (Html msg)
viewHomePage =
    [ H.h1 [] [ H.text "Welcome to my website!" ]
    , H.p [] [ H.text "I made this counter just for you." ]
    , Gen.Components.Counter.init { start = 0 }
    ]
```

We're referencing a `Gen.Components.Counter` in this Html.
Where did this come from?

`prettynice init` created a component at `client/src/Components/Counter.gren`.
When you run `prettynice build`, prettynice looks at all the components in the `Components` directory and generates a corresponding module at `Gen.Components.[ComponentName]` that lets you initialize the component server-side.
This lets you initialize your client-side components with data from the server.
Here we're hard-coding that data, but it could just as easily have come from a database, server-side HTTP call, etc.

Learn more about prettynice components in the next section.
