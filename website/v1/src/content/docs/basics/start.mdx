import { Code, FileTree, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or higher.
2. Create a directory for your site:

   <Code code="mkdir mysite && cd mysite" frame="none" lang="bash" />

3. Set up the starter project template:

   <Code code="npx prettynice init" frame="none" lang="bash" />

4. Start the dev server:

   <Code code="npm run dev" frame="none" lang="bash" />

   and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

   The dev server will watch for changes and rebuild/restart automatically.

</Steps>

## Directory Structure

The important files and directories in a prettynice site are:

<FileTree>
- client
  - src
    - Components # Your client-side components will live here.
        - Counter.gren # An example client-side component.
- public # Public assets (images, css, etc) live here.
    - ...
- server
  - src
    - Main.gren # The server. Entry point for all requests.
</FileTree>

All of your client-side code lives under `client/` and will be compiled into a bundle that targets the browser.

All of your server-side code lives under `server/` and will be compiled into a bundle that targets node.

When you start your app, it runs the server bundle.
The browser bundle and anything under `public/` will be served from that server as static files.

Read on for a detailed explanation of all those files.
