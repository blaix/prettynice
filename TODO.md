  - [X] Think about versioning...
  - [X] Update doc links to use major version prefix: https://github.com/gren-lang/package.gren-lang.org/issues/39
  - [o] Flesh out gren guide as needed:
    - [ ] Add applications section:
      - [ ] The Elm Architecture
        - [ ] See evan's original tutorial on this: https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/tree/2ce0f550cb6331cd5659e6a39095ce8ebfef34c0
        - [ ] Good stuff in the lustre docs too: https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre/blob/main/pages/guide/02-state-management.md
      - [ ] Browser Applications
      - [ ] Node Applications
    - [ ] Add "gren for elm programmers" to appendix?
    - [ ] Elaborate on the FAQ section about differences from elm
  - [ ] Link on github project settings and README
  - [ ] Link to relevant sections from the example READMEs
  - [ ] Link in the error message for failed props parsing
  - [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIPZlrCpwiE should probably be in the docs somewhere...
  - [ ] Deployment example + docs.
    - [ ] sqlite vs postgresql (easy local dev vs easy management deployment?)
    - [ ] Fly.io vs Render.com
    - [ ] docker?
    - [ ] caddy as reverse proxy (and serving static)?
- [ ] Offically announce the release:
  - [ ] blog.blaix.com
  - [ ] zulip
  - [ ] mastodon
  - [ ] discord
  - [ ] twitter?
- [ ] Update to gren 0.4 and the new node and core packages
  - [ ] update shikensu-gren: https://github.com/icidasset/shikensu-gren/blob/6.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#600
  - [ ] Update gren-static-serve
  - [ ] Update html-gren
- [ ] Vite support (required for pencils):
  - [ ] FIRST: consider web components to clean up the "isolate element" js
  - [ ] ALSO FIRST: consider esbuild instead of vite:
    - [ ] Worried vite is overkill, changes too rapidly, and has too much happening implicitly / under the hood
    - [ ] Stuff like this is very troubling (prod vs dev inconsistencies): https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1782409358057603439
  - [ ] Use one of the gren vite plugins?:
    - [ ] https://github.com/gabriela-sartori/vite-plugin-gren (original?)
    - [ ] https://github.com/laurentpayot/vite-plugin-gren (links to gabriella's as "original". why was this created?)
  - [ ] Create a prettynice-specific plugin? https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin
  - [ ] Replace `CodeGen.copyPublicDir` with vite:
    - [ ] Configure the [public dir](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory)?
    - [ ] An assets dir? Lets you have a tailwind.css that's transformed.
    - [ ] Confusing to have both assets and public?
    - [ ] How to make it not suck to reference assets from gren code in a way vite will recognize?
  - [ ] Handle imports in ComponentName.js for (codemirror for pencils, etc.)
  - [ ] `client/src/app.{js,ts}` entry point?
  - [ ] Styling? See `pencils/notes/UI.md`
  - [ ] On the node side:
    - [ ] how does vite normally integration with node? https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-node ?
    - [ ] Handle imports - wait how is prisma working now...?
    - [ ] `server/src/app.{js,ts}` entry point?
    - [ ] what does this mean for `ports.js`?
  - [ ] Nice to haves:
    - [ ] Full-color errors and jump to editor support? https://twitter.com/rhg_dev/status/1779998936578605493
- [ ] Experiment with nested TEA again e.g. standalone modules per route. See `examples/next/tea-modules`.
  - [ ] LOTS of potential here! => see https://dev.to/jmpavlick/for-lack-of-a-better-name-im-calling-it-the-module-pattern-5dfi
  - [ ] and https://dark.elm.dmy.fr/packages/lue-bird/elm-state-interface/latest/
  - [ ] and https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/what-are-your-thoughts-on-the-translator-pattern-for-child-parent-communication/9730
- [ ] Experiment with htmx:
  - [ ] https://htmx.org/essays/when-to-use-hypermedia/
  - [ ] See this experiment / write-up by Mario: https://github.com/supermario/elm-htmx
  - [ ] May be able to incorporate the core 80% without using the library: https://joshi.monster/posts/build-your-own-htmx/
  - [ ] Server-side only dynamic interactions. All logic in one place. [Grug like](https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-soc).
  - [ ] Use case: add/edit/delete items from todo list.
  - [ ] Also look at liveview
  - [ ] ...and SSE
- [ ] See `notes/js-task.md`. Do I need some kind of composable, Task-like interface for js functions yet (will pencils need this for db calls?)?
  - [ ] Would [JTD](https://jsontypedef.com/) be any help here? See https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-duet
- [ ] Consider the list of sveltekit features which mirror a lot of what I want out of a framework: https://kit.svelte.dev/ (see "features? we got em.")
- [ ] Test Sourcemaps
- [ ] Gren compiler errors losing colors in "npm run dev" output?
- [ ] Post video(s) showing off full-stack type safety
- [ ] See https://github.com/MaeBrooks/gren-webserver - there's some cool ideas in here.
- [ ] Look at mdgriffith's elm-prefab: https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-prefab/tree/main/guides - cool ideas here too
- [ ] Add a Dockerfile to the project template?
- [ ] Add tests to the template app
- [ ] Add `__filename` to Node env, `splitPath` to FileSystem, and replace cli's `dirname` port call: https://gren.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/376306-ideas/topic/Node.20bindings.20to.20__dirname.3F/near/425878041
- [ ] `just publish-cli` that runs `build-cli` and validates similar to `gren package validate`
- [ ] Unit Tests. Especially Prettynice.Internal.Props
- [ ] Functional browser tests with playwright or similar
- [ ] Windows support: Remove POSIX path coupling from CodeGen (Shikensu's `*Posix` functions and hardcoded "/")
- [ ] Think about CSS post-processing:
  - [ ] tailwind? (meh)
  - [ ] bulma.io looks nice (no js!), maybe worth a UI package? look at https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/surprisetalk/elm-bulma/
  - [ ] look at <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ryannhg/css-in-elm>
- [ ] Think about JS bundling/transpiling:
  - [ ] vite? support importing .gren files?
  - [ ] swc?
- [ ] Cookies & Sessions
- [ ] Consider: what if I want traditional Flags from js? (right now prettynice controls this to do Props)
- [ ] [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) example app
- [ ] Redirect helpers?
- [ ] Handle multipart/form-data and file uploads
- [ ] Responses that align with the request content-type (e.g. 404 that returns html, string, or json depending on the request)
- [ ] Support records and custom types in component Props field types? See https://github.com/stil4m/elm-syntax for possible reference/example. Or worth waiting for gren-in-gren?
- [ ] Future ideas / Experiments:
  - [ ] component events that can trigger server-side messages: https://gist.github.com/blaix/5184b52b28f53c8019eca4a91e2fa868
  - [ ] HTM[X|Z] integration:
    - [ ] Form submissions? See https://remix.run/docs/en/main/components/form
    - [ ] Server-side components?
    - [ ] toBackend/toFrontend messages?
    - [ ]   replacing the generated script tag with an hx-trigger? https://twitter.com/RustyVermeer/status/1784972656749768739
    - [ ] If I just need to replace elements on the page: https://leanrada.com/htmz/
    - [ ] What about slow connections / failed js loading? See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzLGleT1yrY
- [ ] Speed up build step. Parallelize build tasks? (codegen has to happen before client/server builds)
- [ ] Experiment with portals. Would this help with components at all?
  - [ ] https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal
  - [ ] https://wolfgangschuster.wordpress.com/2023/06/21/bring-your-own-dom-part-1-portals/)?
- [ ] Audit error messages

## Open questions and future ideas

- [ ] No good way to get port and host from env vars for `Prettynice.startProgram`. Currently must be hard-coded or passed in via argv[].
- [ ] Is there anything that can be done about the duplication between Prettynice.gren and Prettynice.SimpleRouter.gren?
- [ ] Should there be a prettynice cli "serve" command?
    - [ ] Originally tried to do this but having trouble getting server's stdout to pass through the parent process
    - [ ] Is there any benefit over running the built server with node directly?
- [ ] Databases:
  - [ ] db-over-http once node HttpClient lands:
    - [ ] couchdb / pouchdb
    - [ ] AWS RDS Data API: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rdsdataservice/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteSql.html
    - [ ] sqlite-over-http? https://github.com/proofrock/ws4sqlite
  - [ ] expand on ports/prisma example?
  - [ ] direct connection over tcp?:
    - [ ] kernel bindings for node's 'net' api
    - [ ] webcrypto for [passwords](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-password.html)? (joeybright working on this?)
    - [ ] example here: https://github.com/Asaye/PgDriverDemo (explanation here: https://info.deal-corner.com/post/311c1057-f94b-4b48-aadc-02de4ee5f0e0)
    - [ ] see this old package for a simpler reference than the current node pg package: https://github.com/creationix/postgres-js
  - [ ] See https://github.com/pghttp and elm-pghttp channel in incremental elm discord
- [ ] SSE? Websockets?
- [ ] SSR + hydration for components? Is there value?
- [ ] Emails? (Mario from Lamdera recommends https://postmarkapp.com/)
- [ ] Metrics and observability?
  - [ ] Prometheus (integrates with Caddy https://caddyserver.com/docs/metrics)?
  - [ ] https://opentelemetry.io/ ?
- [ ] New Temporal API coming for dates/times? https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal
- [ ] Anything to do with webcomponents?: [shoelace](https://shoelace.style/)?
- [ ] Any ideas to steal from Lustre server components?
- [ ] Look at mdgriffith's elm-prefab: https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-prefab/blob/main/guides/
- [ ] Look at [elm-duet](https://github.com/BrianHicks/elm-duet) and [json type definitions](https://jsontypedef.com/)
