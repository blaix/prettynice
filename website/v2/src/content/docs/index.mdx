## Some pretty nice features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="Server-side Simplicity" icon="laptop">
        [Serve your pages](/basics/server/) with
        all content and everything they need for interactivity right from the start.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Client-side Confidence" icon="seti:html">
        [Client components](/basics/client/) are initialized on the server with data that is type-checked at compile time.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Guidance and Guarantees" icon="seti:todo">
        Immutability, strong static types, carefully managed side-effects, and a helpful compiler thanks to [gren](https://gren-lang.org/)
	</Card>
	<Card title="Javascript just where you need it" icon="seti:javascript">
        Want to color outside the lines? Easy access to the full JS ecosystem
        in the [browser](/next/client-js/) _and_ [node](/next/server-js/).

## The Gren Programming Language

Pretty Nice uses [Gren](https://gren-lang.org/), a purely functional language with carefully managed side-effects, a strong static type system, and a helpful compiler.

All of these combined let you code with confidence and peace of mind.
Gren won't let you forget an edge case or accidentally introduce a runtime exception.
You can liberally change and refactor code without worrying that you've missed or broken something.
Create applications that _just work_.

A good place to start learning Gren is [gren-lang.org/learn](https://gren-lang.org/learn)

To get started using Gren for full-stack web applications, head to the [get started page](/basics/start/)!
