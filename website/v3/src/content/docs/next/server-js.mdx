<Aside type="note">
  This page needs to be fleshed out.
  In the meantime, check out the README section on [Javascript Interop in Node](https://github.com/blaix/prettynice?tab=readme-ov-file#javascript-interop-in-node)
  and the [websockets example](https://github.com/blaix/prettynice/tree/main/examples/v3/websockets) which uses both server-side and client-side ports to interact with javascript.
